This was code written for Syracuse Unviersity Professor Kristy Buzard as a research assistant for her project. A method to digitize pictures of old tax documents we had in order to properly format them into excel charts was necessary. These files include multiple versions which were all tested and utilized.

# 1. The first version

[Original Layout Parser Test](https://github.com/ninoc0/Layout-Parser/blob/main/orignal_layout_parser_test.ipynb)


The "original layout parser" was my first version of code. It has a lot of code that ended up being redundant or unnecessary. I published it in case some of the lines I removed become necessary later. To see my current progress check the one titled "Layout Parser Test."

This is unfortunatly not finished, this is just a simple spacial recognition of the tables. Using macheine learning, the detectron will be used to output a clean table format of these old import documents, eventually....

The layout parser update is the newest verson, which has the personalized reading.
