# Layout Parser

This was code written for Syracuse Unviersity Professor Kristy Buzard as a research assistant for her project. A method to digitize pictures of old tax documents we had in order to properly format them into excel charts was necessary. These files include multiple versions which were all tested and utilized.

# 1. The first version

[Original Layout Parser Test](https://github.com/ninoc0/Layout-Parser/blob/main/orignal_layout_parser_test.ipynb) was the first version of this code that I wrote. At the bottom of the Colab page, you can find one of these tax documents and see how the parser read and organized it.

# 2. The final version
[Layout Parser Update](https://github.com/ninoc0/Layout-Parser/blob/main/layout_parser_update.ipynb) is the version that was in use while I was working as an RA. This project was successfully able to block the data into separate lines in order to properly convert it into an excel chart. This project failed in its ability to convert the words on the page into text. This is partially due to low quality of the images and the "detectron" I was using.
