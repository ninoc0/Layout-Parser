# Layout-Parser
The "original layout parser" was my first version of code. It has a lot of code that ended up being redundant or unnecessary. I published it in case some of the lines I removed become necessary later. To see my current progress check the one titled "Layout Parser Test."

This is unfortunatly not finished, this is just a simple spacial recognition of the tables. Using macheine learning, the detectron will be used to output a clean table format of these old import documents, eventually....
